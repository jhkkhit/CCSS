        <p>This aspect covers the generation of <a href="../Definitions#key">cryptographic keys</a> and <a href="../Definitions#seed">seeds</a> that will be used within a cryptocurrency system. The secure creation of cryptographic keys and seeds requires two things to be secure: confidentiality and un-guessable numbers. Confidentiality is required to ensure that the newly created keys or seeds are not read/copied by an unintended party. Un-guessable numbers are required to ensure the newly created key cannot be guessed or determined by an unintended party. Each of the goals listed below provide assurance that the keys and/or seeds are created in a confidential and un-guessable manner.</p>

        <p>This aspect covers the creation of <a href="../Definitions#wallet">wallets</a> or <a href="../Definitions#address">addresses</a> that can receive cryptocurrencies. Wallets are created using key signing methodologies that can require a single key’s signature, multiple keys’ signatures, or a minimum number of signatures from many keys. Furthermore, wallets can be created individually (commonly referred to as JBOK wallets, or “Just a Bunch Of Keys”) or in a deterministic way that allows a set of addresses/key pairs to be created from a single master seed. Security of wallet creation is derived from the integrity of the wallet in the face of various risks such as a lost/stolen/compromised key, and the confidentiality of the wallet that would make it difficult to associate a wallet with a particular <a href="../Definitions#actor">actor</a>.</p>

Requiring 2 or more signatures on a wallet increases the integrity of funds by reducing the risk of theft associated with a compromised key or key holder.

        <p>This aspect covers how cryptographic private <a href="../Definitions#key">keys</a> and <a href="../Definitions#seed">seeds</a> are stored when not being used. To maximize the confidentiality of key material (i.e. <a href="../Definitions#key">keys</a> and <a href="../Definitions#seed">seeds</a>), they should be stored in as secure a manner as business concerns will allow and make use of strategies such as encryption, secret sharing, and physical locks where appropriate. To maximize the integrity of keys/seeds, backups should exist that allow the keys/seeds to be recovered in the event the primary keys become inaccessible. Care should be taken to ensure that backups are stored with at least as much security as the primary keys, if not more. Notably, cryptographic assets that are generated by end-users of a system are not subject to the backup requirements of this section, as enforcing good behavior on end-users is effectively impossible.</p>

        <p>This aspect covers the use of cryptographic <a href="../Definitions#key">keys</a> and/or <a href="../Definitions#seed">seeds</a> to ensure they are used in a secure manner that minimizes the risks to the confidentiality of private keys and integrity of funds. This section does not cover the usage of key backups which are only used in the event the primary key is lost/damaged/inaccessible. A variety of risks are present when using keys that can lead to the loss of funds including dirty signature vulnerabilities (i.e. re-used ‘R’ values), opportunity for malware to copy or modify keys, and malicious insiders who use their authorized access to send unauthorized transactions.</p>

Regardless of the technical skills, knowledge, and experience of staff who build and maintain an information system, it has been proven that third-person reviews very often identify risks and control deficiencies that were either overlooked or underestimated by staff.

        <p>This aspect covers the removal of cryptographic <a href="../Definitions#key">keys</a> from digital media. Due to the manner in which file systems allocate data on digital media, digital forensic techniques can be employed to read old data that has previously been deleted. Proper sanitization of digital media ensures the proper removal of all keys, eliminating the risk of information leakage from decommissioned devices like servers, hard disk drives, and removable storage.</p>

In the event of unexpected behaviour or security incidents, audit logs are an extremely valuable tool that can help investigators understand how the unexpected symptoms occurred and how to resolve the inconsistencies to return the information system to a consistent state. The maintenance of audit logs significantly reduce the risks associated with operational awareness and increase the information system’s ability to correct any inaccuracies.</p>
